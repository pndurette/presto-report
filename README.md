## About

**presto-report** is a simple NodeJS app packaged in a Docker image alongside a full Chrome headless browser. It is based on [zenika/alpine-chrome](https://github.com/Zenika/alpine-chrome) and uses [puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) to crawl the Web and generate PDFs. It supports emailing PDFs with a [free] [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com) API key.

**What it does:**

1. Navigates to https://www.prestocard.ca/en/dashboard/card-activity & signs in;
2. Picks a date range, transaction types(s) (default: 'card loads') and clicks '*View*';
3. Clicks '*Print*' & saves as PDF;
4. *(Optional)* Emails that PDF.



## Installation

```bash
docker pull pndurette/presto-report
```

```bash
cat << EOF > .env
PRESTO_USER=youruser
PRESTO_PASS=yourpass
EOF
```

Define `PRESTO_USER` and `PRESTO_PASS` respectively as your [prestocard.ca](https://www.prestocard.ca/) credentials (see [`.env.example`](.env.example)). 



## Usage

```bash
docker run --rm --privileged --env-file .env pndurette/presto-report --help
```

## Examples

**Last month's report to** `./artifacts/<report>.pdf`:

* Emailing is optional. Mount the `artifact` directory to access your report:

```bash
docker run --rm --privileged --env-file .env \
           -v $(pwd)/artifacts:/artifacts \
           pndurette/presto-report --lastmonth
```

**June 2018's report to** `receipts@company.com`:

* To email, you'll need a [SendGrid API Key](https://sendgrid.com/pricing/) (with at least the 'Mail Send' scopeâ€”it's free for 100 emails/day) set to `SENDGRID_API_KEY` in your `.env` file

* Some expensing systems (like *Chrome River*) that supports receipts emailing allows you to set the 'subjet' to the amount of the expense.

```bash
docker run --rm --privileged --env-file .env \
           -v $(pwd)/artifacts:/artifacts \
           pndurette/presto-report --year 2018 --month 06 \
           --to receipts@company.com \
           --from me@company.com \
           --subject '$100'
```

Last month's report to ``receipts@company.com`

* Any CLI option `opt` can be set via a  `PRESTO_<OPT>` environment variable in `.env` (e.g. `PRESTO_TO`, `PRESTO_FROM`, etc.) as defaults. See [`.env.example`](.env.example).

```bash
docker run --rm --privileged --env-file .env pndurette/presto-report --lastmonth
```

## Caveats 

The error management in this piece of software is *piss-poor at **best***. Effort was made to pre-validate the input, but that's about it. If it hangs, CTRL-C and check your parameters (username, password, api keys) but also the network, etc. Please note that is also my first forray into NodeJS. 

This only supports PRESTO card accounts with one card set up as I don't have a second one to test.
